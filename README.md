===================================================
This version of AAPS was modified to work in full closed loop, exclusively UAM mode during the meal, no carbs entry, no bolus. 
This is not for beginners.
Keep sugar in your pocket. :)

This README is valid for AAPS_2.8.2_UAM_tsunami_v0.6.1

AAPS 2.8.2-UAM_tsunami was based on 2.8.2-UAM-1.6.1 by Mathieu Tellier and modified from there. This code differs significantly from the original and requires different/new settings.

How it works:
The code relies on a situation dependent scaling algorithm. Meals must be "announced" by setting a TT between 80-85 mg/dl, which also triggers a prebolus of user-defined size if TT duration is 30 min or longer.
As long as the TT is running, ISF values as defined in your local profile will be scaled in dependence of current bg, target bg, delta and two scaling model parameters called scale_max & scale_50.
The scaling curve is largely based on the Michaelis-Menten equation (MME) (see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michaelis%E2%80%93Menten_kinetics ). Briefly: Enzyme activity increases with the concentration of available substrates, until the activity is limited by the speed of the enzyme itself.
In diabetes, the most relevant enzymatic functions are carbohydrate digestion, glucose uptake into the bloodstream and glucose uptake into cells (e.g. by insulin). All of these activities become faster the more carbs in the digestive tract or glucose in the bloodstream are available, but slow down once the activity maximum of the respective enzyme is reached. The scaling equation used here takes this principle into account and adjusts ISFs aggressively initially, but slows down the larger delta becomes. The idea is to reduce the risk of hypos by overdosing if delta values are high.

Features of this approach are:

- More intuitive setting of parameters as scaling parameters have a logical foundation / meaning
- The aggressiveness of the scaling curve can be fine-tuned and adjusted to ones personal needs. By using three scaling parameters, the minimum strength (base aggressiveness), intial steepness (local aggressiveness) and maximum strength (global aggressiveness) of the curve can be adjusted separately.
- The scaling equation works for all positive deltas - there is no risk of negative ISF values or unexpected behaviour
- The scaling equation works for all positive base ISFs
- The scaling equation follows a relative scaling approach. This means that if your insulin requirements change due to illness, physical inactivity etc., a profile switch may be all you have to do to get things going again. YDMV.
- The curve is self-limiting - even in situations of extreme sensor failure, ISFs won't go below the specified minimal ISF (ISF * scale_max/100).

UAM_tsunami uses a three-layered approach, consisting of meal handling (or wave 1 (W1)), post-prandial spike handling (or wave 2 (W2)) and handling of presistent highs (auto ISF).
W1: Manually activated by the user by setting a TT of <90, and only active during this TT.
W2: Enabled only during user specified hours and if an array of safety conditions are met (namely a delta of at least 4 mg/dl/5 min, a minimum IOB value specified by the user and a minimum bg of 100 mg/dL).
AutoISF: Code by gazelle (github). Scales ISF if W1 and W2 are inactive and aims to break through persistent highs.

The code follows the above outlined sequence: W1 --> W2 --> autoISF

W1 scaling is depending strongly on delta and, to a slightly lesser extent, the ratio of current bg versus target bg.
W2 scaling uses the same math as W1, but additionally, scale_50 (see below) is weakened by W2 modifier (also described below). If delta is above 8 mg/dl/5 min, the same math as in W1 will be used instead. Unlike W1, W2 is designed to be active during waking hours (i.e. all day), so for additional safety, data smoothing (see below) can be used. Data smoothing is not available for W1 or autoISF at this point.
autoISF uses a different, generally weaker algorithm and is always managing BGs when W1 or W2 are not. It is a safety-net and generally by itself not strong enough to handle unnaounced meals.

Before use, the following parameters need to be set in the OpenAPS SMB preferences (note that some variables used in MTs UAM-1.6.1 have been removed, modified or given entirely new functionality):

- Maximum total IOB OpenAPS can't go over: Standard AAPS setting, which has been linked to UAM functions. Other variables depend on this value, so make sure to set a reasonable maxIOB to avoid overdosing. (see W2 IOB threshold)
- insulinReq delivery percentage: The specified percentage of the calculated required insulin will be delivered. NOTE: Unlike in previous versions, an actual percentage (not a fraction of 1) is required here!
- ev.BG threshold for delivery of >100% insulinReq.: BG prediction above which more than 100% of the calculated required insulin may be delivered.

General ISF scaling parameters
- scale_min: W1 mode only. Lowers the base ISF to the specified percentage. Keeping it at 100% means that at a delta of 0, your base ISF will remain unchanged. If you lower it to 70%, even at a delta of 0, your ISF would be reduced to 70% of its original value.
- scale_50: Delta value at which the halfway point of the scaling window is reached (ISF exactly between the ISFs specified by scale_min and scale_max). Scale_50 represents the local aggressiveness or initial steepness of the curve. The smaller this value, the larger the change in ISF from small deltas will be. The larger this value, the less small fluctuations in delta will impact ISF scaling. (You can simulate the scaling using the provided excel sheet)
- scale_max: Percentage of ISF which represents the minimum ISF value to scale towards. While your ISF (or scale_min ISF) represents the top end of the scaling range, the ISF resulting from scale_max represents the bottom end (100% scaling). Example: If your base ISF is 50 mg/dl/U and your scale_max is 20%, the minimum ISF that will be scaled towards is 50 * 20/100 = 10 mg/dl/U. scale_max represents the global aggressiveness of the curve. Mathematically, this ISF can only be approximated but will never be reached, or in other words: The curve is self-limiting.

W2 functionality
- W2_modifier of scale_50: Multiplier of scale_50 used during 2nd wave assist (outside TT). It weakens scale_50 to shift aggressiveness of the scaling curve towards larger deltas and is therefore a safety feature.
- W2 IOB threshold: Percentage of maxIOB below which W2 assist will be disabled. This parameter is a safety feature.
- W2 assist start time: Hour of the day from when on (and including) W2 assist (OUTSIDE TTs) may be used given a number of other conditions are met. The time limitation reduces the risk of overdosing through e.g. compression lows at night.
- W2 assist end time: Hour of the day until (and including) W2 assist (OUTSIDE TTs) may be used if certain conditions are met.
- Enable data smoothing: Sensor data will be smoothed using a weighted combination of 1st and 2nd order exponential data smoothing functions. The tsunami ISF scaling code heavily relies on good quality data, and a noisy sensor can result in a high risk of hypoglycaemia. Data smoothing means that sudden glucose jumps will be weakened before being used by the scaling algorithm. This increases safety, but may also result in weaker initial responses. By using 1st and 2nd order smoothing functions, this initial lag time can be kept relatively short. Data smoothing in v0.6.1 is currently only implemented into W2 functionality as W1 mode is activated manually before a meal.

Other UAM settings
- UAM prebolus: Automatic prebolus delivered upon starting a TT below 90 mg/dl and a minimum duration of 60 min.
- UAM bolus cap: SMBs triggered by W1 and W2 assists wil be limited by the quantity stated here. Basal minutes are NOT used by W1 and W2!

MT : AIMI add
in this version, i add AIMI code : use it with button TT (in all my test i used medium meal)
You can try for a small meal without TT like a light breakfast or a snack
-target management
-csf = (isf / IC) will have an impact on the isf in some condition and on the smb boost
-UAM_PBolus2 is the BOOST insulin variable, will be use when 6<csf<10 & IOBpredBG > 80 => in this case SMB = UAM_Pbolus2/ISF2. if CSF < 6 & IOB < 20% IOBMAX, SMB = UAM_PBolus2
-ISF Modifier will be use if CSF < 10 => ISF / UAM_ISF2 or if hypopredbg < 100 ISF = ISF + (hypobredBG/UAM_ISF2)
-an other code is in test, mean comment for now who will manage it without TT during the meal. I'm steal working on the good condition to let him play.

my settins :
-insulinReq : 75%
-EventualBG : 160
-scale min 70%
-scale_50 : 2
-scale_max : 20 %
-W2 modifier of scale_50 : 1.7
-W2 IOB threshold : 20%
-UAM PBolus : 2.5
-BOOST Insulin : 1
-ISF Modifier : 2

==========================================
2.8.2-AIMI-tsunami-0.6.3
no need to change settings, this version manage the target differently, the variation is more precise.
sensitivituRation change too for better result in my test
enjoy :)
=2.8.2-AIMI-tsunami-0.6.4=================
In this version :
-target management was modified for better action in case of small activity
-SMB management is different. i used a prediction on 4 hours to determine the started action. Two news variables will be use in the code EBG and REBG to determine insulinReq
-a new variable in settings, who is the average of carbs per day. This one will use to determine a maxiob for breakfast, lunch and dinner
during my test i didn't use TT. The best result come with a prebolus. If you use it without prebolus, the rise will stop around 200, sometime 220, but will come back in few time, in range.
An other strategy, was to eat a small thing before the meal, that will send like a prebolus and the loop will manage the rest of the meal and post meal.
Other point, i volontary disable the possibility to change some settings. The idea is to observe if this can be good for everyone. Like it's the first time, i'm not sure it will take your settings or the default. let me know :)
Enjoy :)

==================================
AIMI-tsunami-0.6.5

This version is about to perform the smb differently, with a better anticipation of the target management.
Everage of carbs by day is not use, like in the 0.6.4, replace by eMaxIOB
keep sugar with you in case :)
Don't need to use TT. Prebolus is sweetable, but the script can manage the meal without. Up to you to explore this possibility :)
enjoy :)

==================================
AIMI-tsunami-0.6.6

this version will use EBG60 to determine the size of the SMB instead of EBG, when HyperPredBGTest is greater than 600.
BolusCap will be the value of maxbolus in this case, adjuts his value in the settings.
EBG60 will be use to determine the target when EBG60<90 && EBG60<0 (this was really efficient yesterday during my activity)
Since i pratice activity everyday i have to change a little bit my settings, insulinReq at 50% instead of 65% and W2modifier at 1.8 instead of 1.5
Enjoy :-) and keep sugar in your pocket !

=====================================
AIMI Update 04/08/21:
New variable Hyper_BG = 450 by default. The scale smb will start if at minimum the prediction > 450
Since two version the code for smoothie data and autoISF is not used, or almost not used. I delete both.
Enjoy, i got really good result :)
Style working on the plugin version :)

======================================
AIMI V2
We talk a lot about safety, without really find a good way to avoid the 2% of hypoglycÃ©mia with overdosing situation.
For this version i contain the AIMI SMB code to a TT > 29 minutes, target between 80 and 85. prebolus can be send or not.
I test it with 120 minutes duration and its was managed fine.
This update is the way to prepare AIMI for the dev version, an other project, with AIMI like a pluggin, with the idea, than a prebolus will define the meal start for the next three hours, the smb size will come from AIMI not aaps standard.
Everyone is agree to say prebolus is necessary, out of the three hours after the prebolus, the aaps will works witrh target & ISF management to adjust the profile.
